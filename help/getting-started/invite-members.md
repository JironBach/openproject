# Invite team members

In order to see a project and work in it, you have to be a member of a project. Therefore, you have to add team members to a project.

<div class="notice">

**Note**: If you are not a member of a project, you do not see the project in the Project selection nor in the project list.

## Add existing members

To add existing users to a project, [select the project](./project-admin-guide/#select-a-project) where you want to add members. In the project menu on the left, select the **Members** menu item.

In the Members list you will get an overview of which users are already a member of this project.

Type in the name of the team member which you want to add. You can also choose several at a time. **Assign a role** to the new member(s) and click the blue **Add** button.

## Invite new members

You can also invite new members who have not yet an OpenProject account. [Select the project](./project-admin-guide/#select-a-project) where you want to add members. In the project menu on the left, select the **Members** menu item.

Type in the email address of the new member. If OpenProject does not find an existing user, the **Invite** information will automatically be put before the email address. Assign a role to this new member and click the blue **Add** button.

An e-mail invitation will be sent out to the user with a link to [create an account](#create-a-new-account) in OpenProject.
