# Installation and Operation Guides

This section concerns the installation, upgrading, backup, and other operation guides for the OpenProject Community and Enterprise editions.



## Installing OpenProject

OpenProject provides three different means of installation on Linux and Unix distributions.

1. [The packaged installation](packaged/installation)
2. [The docker-based installation](docker/installation)
3. [The manual installation](docker/installation)



For production environments and when using a [supported distribution](system-requirements), we recommend using the [packaged installation](packaged/installation). This will install OpenProject as a system dependency using your distribution's package manager, and provide updates in the same fashion that all other system packages do.



## Upgrading, Backup and Maintenance

For upgrading, backup and migration guides, please select the installation method you have chosen for installing OpenProject on your server:

- [The packaged installation](packaged)
- [The docker-based installation](docker)
- [The manual installation](docker)
